## Welcome to Cube Maker Unofficial v1.2!

Hey everyone! I'd like to share with you my progress on updating Cube Maker to be more user friendly, have more features, and generally provide a better time for generating dice. This **Python** script currently only works with **BlueStacks** and contains the following new features:
- Slightly refactored codebase with improvements to thread handling
- UI Improvements
- Dice Count Tracker
- Earned Dice Tracker
- Control over the buffer period (for those with potato PC's or NASA rigs)
- Live milestone bar tracker

The script also already assumes it's in the C:\platform-tools:\ directory alongside your ADB files. 
*Please see here ([▶ dice.exe setup (figma.com)](https://www.figma.com/proto/2d3icPqyv5V8ow4EWgOmvl/Untitled?type=design&node-id=124-84&t=oXRlJ0X4ydqPNtpJ-0&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1) for help on getting the ADB folder set up in the right spot alongside your system's environment variables if you haven't already.* 

If there is interest, I'll wrap this up as an executable but for now it's just a .py script because I wanted to get it out there. Let me know if you guys encounter any bugs, it's definitely still far from perfect. I will not be incorporating compatibility with other emulators, but I welcome somebody else to take on the challenge!

How To Run:
- With Python IDLE, just edit the file in IDLE and click F5.
- With CMD, navigate to the platform-tools directory and type *'python -m dicemaker1.2.py'*
